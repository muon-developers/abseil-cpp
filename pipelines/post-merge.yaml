# Pipeline to run Bazel tests post-merge onto master
 
# allow CI builds only on master branch by excluding all other branches.
# enforce batch run, which will test all changes at once. This should result in a single run per PR that is merged onto master.
# the single run will include all changes introduced by the PR, instead of testing them sequentially.
